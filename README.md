Educational keylogger demonstration for cybersecurity learning

# Keystroke Monitoring – Ethical Security Lab

## Overview
This project is a simple Python-based keystroke monitoring script developed in a controlled lab environment for educational purposes. The goal is to understand how keystroke logging techniques are used in real-world attacks and how such activity can be detected and mitigated from a defensive (blue team) perspective.

## Purpose
- Study basic attacker techniques used in credential theft
- Understand risks associated with spyware and keylogging
- Improve awareness of endpoint security and detection strategies

## Scope & Limitations
- Runs only in a foreground session
- Logs keystrokes locally to a text file
- No persistence, privilege escalation, or network exfiltration
- Intended strictly for ethical learning and testing

## Technologies
- Python
- Kali Linux
- pynput library

## Ethical Notice
This project is for educational and ethical cybersecurity learning only. It should only be run on systems you own or have explicit permission to test.
